# design-and-uml-voice-message-system-gander392
This is a set of UML diagrams and tools for building a company-wide phone voice messaging system. There is a use-case diagram, a data dictionary, a list of scenarios 
for accessing a mailbox, retrieving a message, deleting a message, and leaving a message, sequence diagrams for those scenarios, and a class diagram. The UML 
diagrams were built using an existing phone system API and customer-provided specifications. The use-case diagram lists all the use cases that can be performed
between the mail system, which contains mailboxes, and the three user types of caller, owner, and administrator. The data dictionary lists and explains all the
necessary components of the message system. The class diagram includes all of the classes required for the message system and details the relationships between them.
